	Lets take it all the way back to my time on tatoinne. ah, seems like forever since I was on that sand planet. Can't say I miss it. I grew up there with my mother, until I was taken one day by some hippie and his bratty understudy whose barber forgot to cut off one strand of hair that just flopped around the entire time. Anyway,they brought me back to this huge building that they called a temple (had about as much energy as you would expect from a bunch of monks). They taught me how to move rocks with my mind and how to trick people with just a wave of my hand, helped when I wanted to go drinking on the weekend but didn't have the money. You don't join the Jedi for the salary. They taught me how to use a lazer sword, to be honest I'm suprised no one cut their hand off the entire time I was there. Around my early 20's war broke out between the Replubic and some very ugly looking lizard things. They were hideous. The war didn't last long, but we foundout that it had been orchestrated by the Sith who at the time we thought had been wiped out for a very long time. While this is all going on I'm trying to have a relationship with Senator Padme, which the Jedi would not look kindly upon.

	<P style="color:white;"> Long story short, I lose faith in the order I had been with for so long and the Emperor gave me a way out. I almost singlehandely wiped out all the Jedi and most of the younglings, but hey, it was just one of those days. I was in a mood. I lost a fight to my best friend and now I'm stuck in a metal suit because I wanted the High Ground. So now I'm traveling across the Galaxy to wipe out any remaining brown robed hooligans. Couldn't ask for anything better.
